# Loupe-UnityProject

## Introduction

Bart Blaak, an intern at the Practorate Interactive Technology of ROC Tilburg (PIT)[^1], built an AR environment with which you can master teaching material in 3D-AR, using a Microsoft HoloLens 2. This is possible with an unlimited number of people at the same time, who can be located anywhere in the world, in separate locations. Bart made this product as a Fontys ICT trainee at PIT. An augmented reality (AR) app has been developed with which teachers can support their lessons via the Microsoft HoloLens 2. The AR app, called Loupe, makes it possible for teachers and students to collaborate simultaneously in separate locations with custom 3D models in the context of practice-oriented education. Of course, the teachers and students can also do this in the same room. Teachers can import their own 3D models (created themselves, scanned themselves, or purchased via the internet) into the app to make them useable for their education. The applications are wide; it can be used for both practical and theoretical lessons. As an example, consider learning the different components of an engine block or organ. It can be used in almost all majors.
